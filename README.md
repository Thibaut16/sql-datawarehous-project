# 📊 Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

Welcome! 👋
This repository showcases a **portfolio project inspired by Data with Baraa**, designed as both a **hands-on tutorial** and a **practical implementation of industry standards** in **data engineering and analytics**.

The project demonstrates how to design, build, and analyze a modern data warehouse to transform raw data into actionable insights.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

* Build a **modern data warehouse** using **SQL Server**
* Integrate multiple data sources into a **clean, analytics-ready model**
* Deliver **SQL-based analytics and reporting** to support data-driven decision-making

This project follows real-world best practices, from data ingestion and cleansing to business-focused reporting.

## 🏗️ Part 1: Data Engineering – Building the Data Warehouse

### 🎯 Objective

Develop a **centralized data warehouse** that consolidates sales data from multiple systems, enabling efficient analytical reporting and informed business decisions.

### 📌 Requirements & Specifications

* **Data Sources**

  * Two operational systems: **ERP** and **CRM**
  * Data provided as **CSV files**

* **Data Quality**

  * Clean and standardize the data
  * Identify and resolve data quality issues (duplicates, nulls, inconsistencies)

* **Data Integration**

  * Merge ERP and CRM data into a **single, unified data model**
  * Design the model for **high-performance analytical queries**

* **Scope**

  * Focus on the **latest available data only**
  * Historical tracking and slowly changing dimensions are **out of scope**

* **Documentation**

  * Provide clear and concise documentation
  * Ensure accessibility for **business stakeholders** and **analytics teams**

## 📈 Part 2: Business Intelligence – Analytics & Reporting

### 🎯 Objective

Develop **SQL-based analytical queries** that transform warehouse data into meaningful insights for stakeholders.

### 🔍 Key Analytical Areas

The analytics layer focuses on delivering insights into:

* **Customer Behavior**

  * Purchasing patterns
  * Customer segmentation
  * Engagement trends

* **Product Performance**

  * Best- and worst-performing products
  * Revenue contribution by product

* **Sales Trends**

  * Sales growth and seasonality
  * Performance over time

These insights empower decision-makers with **reliable KPIs and metrics** to support strategic planning and operational improvements.
